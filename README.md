# meteor-react-sprite-field

A simple play field, key listeners to control each character, sprites managed with scss and state variables.



All done in react on top of meteor.  Meteor is currently not even used, other than the startup Render function.
Meteor could be used to manage users and to store game data and share across multiple users.  


Sprites size calculated with the help of  http://www.spritecow.com


TTD  
- refactor helper functions in the characters  in to one helper class
